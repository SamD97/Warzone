Warzone
=======

A fun android game under development!

It has a stickman as the main character. He is in the middle of a war zone where missiles are showering over him. Your goal is to make him dodge missiles for as long as possible.

Project Details
===============

The game is in its early stages. The code is completely uncommented and may be very difficult to understand (In my defence, I didn't know about github or opensource development when I started making this game! So i didn't see the need for comments).

Changes
========
v0.2 :
 * pause, and game over features
 * slide (swipe down)
 * new buttons

v0.1 :
 * bare minimal game
 * jump (swipe up)

TODO
====

 * Write a better missile generation algorithm
 * Create stickman_hit animation, and improve animation of being thrown away
 * Add music in the game
 * Add slide feature
