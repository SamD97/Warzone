Warzone
=======

A fun android game under development!

It has a stickman as the main character. He is in the middle of a war zone where missiles are showering over him. Your goal is to make him dodge missiles for as long as possible.

Project Details
===============

The game is in its early stages. The code is completely uncommented and may be very difficult to understand (In my defence, I didn't know about github or opensource development when I started making this game! So i didn't see the need for comments).

Note: If you play this game, and your health goes zero, the game will look like it has hanged. But it actually hasn't, the sprites just stop moving. Thats just how it is for now. You can go back and restart it again.

TODO
====

[ ] Write a better missile generation algorithm
[ ] Use more realistic explosion animation
[ ] Create stickman_hit animation, and improve animation of being thrown away
